    char_poliana "Oh good God! We’re finally here!"

    char_onyx "Yeah, it was funny how we almost got lost on the way here"

    char_poliana"We almost got lost!? I didn’t notice it, I was trusting you 100\%...\ Wait a minute"

    char_poliana "Oh my God! That music fucking slaps! I wonder who is playing right now"

    char_onyx "You get sidetracked really easily, Poliana! I’ve have no idea as to who is playing right now, I forgot to check the timetable before coming here, but I believe it should be either DJ Lau or DJ Elk by the way the beat is progressing"

    char_poliana "Huh, we should go check the main stage soon! But wait, have you heard from Janice? Wasn’t she supposed to be here already?"

    char_onyx "Well, as she got here earlier, she must be lost somewhere on the party… We should go looki*"

    char_aj "Sorry to interrupt fellas, how are ya doing? Does any of ya have a lighter so I could light my cig?"

    char_poliana "…"
    
    char_poliana "That’s strange, he looks a tad bit too young to be here, but he has the voice of some old hooligan, I wonder where he came from."

    char_onyx "Hm… Are you sure you are allowed here buddy?"

    char_onyx "He looks even younger than Poliana, should I worry about his ID? I know that a party in an abandoned warehouse isn’t expected to follow some strict rules…"

    char_aj "WHAT OF COURSE I AM! I just got a pretty good skin care routine… Anyway, sorry if we got started on the wrong foot mate, the name is Ajax"

    char_poliana "Be sure to take it easy buddy, my name is Poliana!"

    char_onyx "And I’m Onyx"

    char_aj "Poliana and Onyx! Great names!"

    char_aj "So! What do you guys expect from this ‘MONSTROUS’ Rave!?"

    char_onyx "Welp, I dunno to be honest, I got my invitations late and wasn’t expecting to come here before only like, two days ago, so my only hope is to have fun!"

    char_onyx "Yeah, that’s what I want, I hope grandma is alright, she insisted on me coming even though today was the penultimate chapter of our favorite ‘novela’, I hope we get to watch it together soon."

    char_poliana "Hmmm, I just wanna have a good time with my friends, and maybe even meet some cool new people!"

    char_poliana "Honestly I just wanna drink enough till I forget my own name, what a shitty week I had."

    char_onyx "And what about you Ajax?"

    char_am "Well, I hope to meet with some old acquaintances and eat some good dinner here soon, the munchies are killing me!"

    char_poliana "Wait! There’s food at this party? That’s cool as hell, I might go looking for that later!"

    char_onyx "…"

    char_onyx "That’s weird, from what I read before, there would be no food here, only alcohol, I wonder if it was a recent addition."

    char_aj "Hahaha, sure, good luck, I already know where I’m gonna be filling meself up though!"

    char_aj "Anyway, it was a good chat, see ya ‘round later, thanks for the lighter!"

    char_onyx "What a strange little guy…"

    char_poliana "For sure, but he seems inoffensive at least."

    char_onyx "Yeah, I guess so, anyway, we should go looking for Janice, she must be feeling lost!"

    char_am "Excuse me, have you seen…"

    char_polianaamalia "We almost got lost!? I didn’t notice it."

    char_am "Ohhh, that is so uncanny, you look like my doppelganger! What is your name, oh fair maiden?"
    
    char_poliana "My name is Poliana, and I definitely got scared at seeing my own face, haha, what about you?"

    char_poliana "She seems odd..."
    
    char_am "WAIT WE HAVE THE SAME NAME TOO!"

    char_poliana "Really!?"

    char_am "Nope, just kidding, haha, my name is Amalia, it’s a pleasure to meet you!"

    char_poliana "The pleasure is mine!"

    char_poliana "What does it mean to meet her here out of all places? It is slightly unnerving to see myself not in a mirror, my reflection is already enough to catch me off guard"

    char_onyx "And I’m Onyx!"

    char_am "Oh sorry for not addressing you dear! I got distraught by this pretty face here"

    char_poliana "Inner monologue: Oh good God, is she flirting with me? Why?
    So what were you going to say before we crossed eyes?
    "

    char_am "Oh, I forgot, I believe I was looking for someone, but if I can’t remember it, it mustn’t be that important"

    char_onyx "She seems to be making excuses to socialize more."

    char_poliana "Okay then… So I guess we can chat a bit! Please tell me more about you! I’m very curious to know more about my doppelganger!"

    char_am "Well… Where do I even begin? I’m 21 years old, and I just enrolled on the Pychology program of this city's University!…"

    char_poliana "Oh psychology? I didn’t know this course was available here, I believe we must be enrolled on the same University, as my story is pretty similar, I’m also 21 years old, haha, but I study literature"

    char_poliana "I should research the University more, I swear I knew all the courses…"

    char_am "Oh, that’s so cool, I love the works of Mary Shelley, I find it very fascinating, from a psychology standpoint, I’ve got no idea as for what I could do with such a ‘monster’."

    char_poliana "Oh…"

    char_poliana "What a curious statement to say the least…"

    char_poliana "I love to dabble in horror, from time to time"

    char_poliana "Well, I could say I even write them, but I don’t think she would be interested…"

    char_onyx "Yeah! My friend here is gonna write great books, you should read her Texas Chainsaw Massacre fanfic! I can’t wait for her first original story!"

    char_onyx "Better help Poliana here, she can be denser than me when it comes to girls"

    char_poliana "HEY!"

    char_poliana "Don’t go sharing it like that! I’m not confident enough in my stories yet, I need some non biased readers! haha"

    char_am "Welp, I always accept a good excuse to read more, it would be a pleasure to be one of your readers and maybe get to know you more through your writing!"

    char_poliana "I might share the link with you later then…"

    char_poliana "Good God! Why would Onyx throw me under the spotlight just like that!"

    char_am "Okeydokey darling!"

    char_onyx "So, Amalia right? What would you say you expect from this party? Some bloke just asked us that before, and I guess it is a good ice breaker question, haha"

    char_am "I guess… Romance, my mom keeps talking all the time about how I need someone to “love”, not sure why she’s so insistent on it, but I’m currently open to trying"

    char_poliana "Mom!? Why do I always get triggered when people have good relationships with their moms!?"

    char_poliana "I bet your mom at least seems nice, either way, good luck in your search!"

    char_am "Maybe I already found what I was looking for! Anyway good party guys, I’m gonna go looking for my friend Ajax!"

    char_poliana "Byee"

    char_onyx "Romance huh? haha, She seems like a self-loving person, maybe you two should chat up a bit more later"

    char_onyx "Curious how she appears to be friends with Ajax, they have very different vibes, I think I’m gonna see those two again later"

    char_poliana "Yeah… Maybe"

    char_poliana "Not sure If I would be interested in dating such a look-alike, but I’m gonna think about it…"

    char_onyx "Anyway girl! Let’s go looking for Janice as well, she must be worried since we have yet to find her, haha"

    char_poliana "You are right! Let 's go!"
