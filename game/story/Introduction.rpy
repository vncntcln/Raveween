    scene a2 with fade

    "We live in a mysterious world, under the chains of our virtues and vices we follow along society's pathâ€¦"

    "What you are about to see, is the story of those who endure adversity while enveloped by anxieties and the dread of being, those immersed in a path of distrust, those that are lost in the eternal diversity of life, those who look."

    "In the search for good times, we get blindsided by what stops us, the ones who keep moving, to the beat of the music, to the beat of the soul, are our subject today."

    "May you keep moving as well."
